# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) provides 25 coding
puzzles. I have decided to solve these in a variety of different languages
including ones I use day-to-day (like Perl 5 and Javascript), ones I'm
familiar with but get to use less often (like PHP, Python, Ruby, C, and Java),
and ones I'm still learning (like Rust and Raku).

## Goals

- at least 8 days solved in Rust 2021
- at least 8 days solved in Perl 5
- at least 4 days solved in Javascript (node)
- at least 4 days solved in PHP
- at least 2 days solved in Raku
- at least 2 days solved in Python
- at least 2 days solved in Ruby
- at least 1 day solved in C
- at least 1 day solved in Java

That's 32 solutions for 25 puzzles, so some days will have multiple solutions.
